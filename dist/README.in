Web Site: http://xplc.sourceforge.net/
Maintainer: Pierre Phaneuf <pp@ludusdesign.com>

General
-------

Do not use XPLC unless you actually work on it. :-)

Thanks
------

I would like to thank Net Integration Technologies, my employers, for
allowing me to work on XPLC a day a week and generally being a cool
place to work at.

License
-------

All files included in this package are covered by the Lesser General
Public License, unless noted otherwise. Refer to the 'LICENSE' file
for terms and conditions.

Releases
--------

XPLC uses a numbering scheme for releases similar to what the Linux
kernel uses. In short, a release number is composed of three parts,
the major, minor and patchlevel numbers (like this: 3.4.31).

The minor number has a special signification depending on whether it
is even or odd. If it is even, it means that this is a stable release,
suitable for use in a production environment. If it is odd, it means
that this is a development release, intended for people willing to
test XPLC, report bugs and/or work on its development.

Installation
------------

See the 'INSTALL' file.

Patches
-------

Patches should preferably be submitted to the patch tracking system on
our SourceForge project page (http://sourceforge.net/projects/xplc/),
but could also be send via e-mail to the maintainer.

                          *** IMPORTANT ***
Before preparing a patch, you should make sure that 'make tests'
passes all tests. Those tests are made to be as easy to use as
possible, so please use them. Using the "--enable-fatal-warnings"
option of the "configure" script is also recommended.

The simpler way to prepare a patch requires CVS and Internet
access. Just issue the following command in the root XPLC project
directory:

$ cvs diff -u > mypatch.diff

You can also send a patch that is limited to a few files in the
following way:

$ cvs diff -u [FILES] > mypatch.diff

If you do not have CVS and/or Internet access, you should do the
following:

 - rename the XPLC source directory to something like 'xplc-modified'
 - unpack the fresh XPLC sources
 - run the following command:

$ diff -ruN xplc-X.Y.Z xplc-modified > mypatch.diff

You can then submit the mypatch.diff file for inclusion in XPLC!
