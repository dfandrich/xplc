.SH NAME
uuidgen \- a universally unique identifier (UUID) generator for XPLC
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B uuidgen
[
.IR OPTION
] ...
.br
.B uuidcdef
[
.IR OPTION
] ...
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B uuidgen
generates a new universally unique identifier (UUID).  This UUID can
be assumed to be unique to any other UUIDs generated on the local
system, as well as those created on any other systems, at any time in
the past or future.

By default,
.B uuidgen
will try to generate a UUID with as much randomness as possible.  It
tries to pick out a high-quality randomness source.  If it cannot find
one, it will fall back on using a time-based algorithm.
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-cdef
Print the UUID as an initializer for a C structure, compatible with
the type used by XPLC.

This is the default mode for
.BR uuidcdef .
.\"
.TP
.B \-r, \-\-random
Demand that the random-based algorithm be used to generate the UUID.
This will prefer a high-quality randomness source, but may fall back
on a low-entropy one.
.\"
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-time
Demand that the time-based algorithm be used to generate the UUID.
.\"
.TP
.B \-u, \-\-uuid
Print the UUID like: "26175a27-c35d-4615-8dfb-1509eab28ef8".
This is the
.BR printf (3)
format: "%08x-%04x-%04x-%04x-%012x".

This is the default mode for
.BR uuidgen .
